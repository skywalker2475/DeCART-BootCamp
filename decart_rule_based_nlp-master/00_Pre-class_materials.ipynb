    "A hypothetical healthcare delivery system has asked us to determine whether use of opioids is associated with increased risk of community-acquired pneumonia in adults. We have two-and-a-half days to identify patients with pneumonia so that the health services team can assess the risk based on pharmacy data. There is not enough time to manually read through the thousands of charts, so we will apply natural language processing for the task. Student teams in this course will collaboratively build an NLP application for identifying patients with pneumonia from a publicly available dataset. You will apply existing tools to annotate a reference standard and to create a computable knowledge base (OWL ontology) of conditions in the CDC pneumonia case definition. You will then use the pyConText library to build rule-based NLP tools to identify those conditions in clinical reports and determine which patients have pneumonia. We will evaluate the predictive performance of the tools and discuss the costs and benefits of rule-based NLP.\n",
